**Code**:

fread to get columns based on col name

-   gene of interest: SOX2 (ENSG00000181449)

-   area of interest: HES1

getting the row names (list of gene names)

```{r}
library(vroom)

# Specify the path to your .tsv.gz file
file_path <- "./GSE162170/GSE162170_multiome_rna_counts.tsv.gz"

# Specify the columns you want to read by name or index
# For example, to read the first five columns, you can specify their indices as 1:5
# If you know the column names, you can specify them directly
columns_to_read <- 1

**GLM**:

Let $Y_{ij}$ represent the count of (spliced or unspliced) RNA for gene $i$ in cell $j$.

$Y_{ij} \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_{ij})$ with rate $\lambda{ij}$*,* where$\lambda{ij}$ is the expression level of gene $i$ in cell $j$. The PMF of the Poisson distribution is $P(Y_{ij} = k) = \frac{\lambda_{ij}^k e^{-\lambda_{ij}}}{k!}$, for $y = 0, 1, 2, ...$

Let $X_{kj}$ denote the accessibility (0 for closed, 1 for open) of region $k$ in cell $j$. $X_{kj} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_{kj})$ with probability $p_{kj}$, where $p_{kj}$ is the probability of region $k$ being accessible in cell $j$. The PMF of the Bernoulli distribution is: $P(X_{kj} = x) = p_{kj}^x (1 - p_{kj})^{1-x}$ for $x \in {0, 1}$.

**Linking Function:** log link model: $\log(\lambda_{ij}) = \beta_0 + \sum_{k=1}^n \beta_k X_{kj}$, where $\beta_0$ is the intercept and $\beta_k$ are coefficients.

-   zero-inflated models

Reversing the direction of the relationship in a hierarchical Bayesian model to predict ATAC-seq data (chromatin accessibility) from RNA-seq data (gene expression) is an intriguing approach, particularly given the interplay between gene expression and chromatin state. Here's how you could structure such a model:

\### Conceptual Framework for RNA-seq to ATAC-seq Prediction

1\. \*\*Model Objective\*\*: Predict binary chromatin accessibility states (ATAC-seq data) from gene expression levels (RNA-seq data).

2\. \*\*Latent Variable\*\*: Introduce a latent variable representing an underlying biological process that influences both gene expression and chromatin accessibility.

3\. \*\*Hierarchical Structure\*\*:

-   \*\*Layer 1 (Data Level)\*\*: RNA-seq data (gene expression counts) and ATAC-seq data (binary chromatin accessibility states).

-   \*\*Layer 2 (Latent Variable)\*\*: The latent variable captures the transcriptional regulatory state, influenced by gene expression and affecting chromatin accessibility.

-   \*\*Layer 3 (Parameters)\*\*: Parameters define the relationship between gene expression and the latent variable, and between the latent variable and chromatin accessibility.

\### Formulating the Hierarchical Model

1\. \*\*Defining the Latent Variable (Z)\*\*:

-   $Z_i$ represents the latent transcriptional regulatory state for gene $i$.

2\. **Modeling the First Relationship (Gene Expression to Z)**:

-   If \\( Y_i \\) is the count of gene expression for gene $i$, model the relationship to $Z_i$ (e.g., using a log link function in a Poisson regression):

$Z_i = f(\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \log(Y_i + 1))$

-   $f$ might be a function ensuring the latent variable's appropriate range, with $\alpha_0, \alpha_1$ as parameters.

3\. **Modeling the Second Relationship (Z to Chromatin Accessibility)**:

-   Let $X_i$ be the binary chromatin accessibility state for gene $i$. Model this with a Bernoulli process, where the probability $p_i$ is a function of $Z_i$:

$X_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_i)$

$p_i = g(\beta_0 + \beta_1 Z_i)$

-   $g$ could be a logistic function, ensuring $p_i$ lies between 0 and 1.

**Wed Jan 24**

match unmatched scRNA and scATACseq

Seurat 3.0: CCA + MNN

**Proposed Parametric Model**

1\. **Model Objective**: The goal is to develop a model that uses gene expression profiles (RNA-seq) to predict chromatin accessibility states (ATAC-seq) for corresponding genomic regions. This implies a relationship where gene expression influences or is indicative of chromatin accessibility.

2\. **Formulating the Model**:

-   Let $Y_i$ represent the RNA expression level for gene $i$, modeled by a Poisson (or negative binomial) distribution.

-   Let $X_i$ represent the chromatin accessibility (binary) at a region associated with gene $i$, modeled by a Bernoulli distribution.

3\. **Linking RNA-seq to ATAC-seq**: a link function that connects the Poisson-distributed RNA-seq data to the Bernoulli-distributed ATAC-seq data. A potential approach could be a logistic regression model where the log-odds of chromatin accessibility are modeled as a function of gene expression levels:

$\log\left(\frac{P(X_i = 1)}{1 - P(X_i = 1)}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Y_i$

Here, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are parameters to be estimated, linking gene expression to chromatin accessibility.

4\. **Parameter Estimation**: The parameters $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ can be estimated using maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian methods, depending on the approach and the inclusion of prior knowledge.

        -   (iso5, iso10, cellenONE) they are different printing methods (iso5: stop after 5 drops of no cell; iso10: stop after 10 drops of no cell; cellenONE: one cell per well, dispose no cell droplets based on prediction)

        -   neuronetwork decide whether cell present in well (after examining the picture after printing)

        -   compare quality of those three printing methods

    -   benchmarking cell cycle calling classification algorithms (on Buettner, Hayashi, and VASAseq(next step) datasets)

        -   supports dimensionality reduction like pca, tsne, umap, and clustering

        -   accuracy of integration heavily relies on the quality and comparability of the datasets

        -   challenging interpretation

    -   CCA

    -   non-negative matrix factorization

        -   multiomics data structure: multiple layers of omic data. Each layer (like transcriptomic, proteomic data) can be represented as a matrix where columns represent samples, and rows represent molecular features.

        -   NMF reduces the dimensionality of each omic layer by extracting latent features that capture the most relevant patterns in the data.

        -   integration: concatenate then NMF or NMF separately to each dataset then compare results

        -   input: multiple matrices

        -   bayesian factor analysis model, It identifies latent factors and learns the weights (loadings) for each feature in each dataset, explaining how much each feature contributes to each factor.

        -   output: latent factors, and how each feature contributes to the latent factors.

        -   assumes linear relationships

        -   challenging to interpret
